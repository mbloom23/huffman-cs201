# huffman201

This project implements Huffman coding for lossless file compression. The binary tree is built out of `HuffNode` classes and 
then used to write the compressed file. Methods are included in the `HuffProcessor` class to support compression and decompression, and the `data` 
folder in this repository contains example image and text files for testing.
